# aoc-go

This is me solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in go, just
for fun. I do these after the fact, for my attempts to get on the leaderboard
take a look at [my main repo](https://github.com/rHermes/adventofcode).

I want to expand this client to have auto downloading of inputs and submission
later, but that will be for another day.
